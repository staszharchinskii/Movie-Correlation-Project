# Movie-Correlation-Project
For this project I used data on films from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies
In this project, I prepared the data, analysed and investigated the correlation in the data using pandas and numpy libraries. I also created data visualisation using matplotlib and seaborn libraries. The conclusion was that 'votes' and 'budget' have the highest correlation to gross earnings.
